    "\n",
    "**Functions** and **methods** are how you \"do stuff\" in Python. With one line of code you can do things like calculate a mean, or do a plot, or do a complicated statistical analysis. In essence, both **functions** and **methods** are code that accept an \"input\", do something to the input, and spits out an \"output\". The only thing you need to know and remember is the name of the function (or method). Arguably, learning Python is mostly learning the names of the available functions and methods.\n",
